# Self Assessment Interpreter

Fast and automatic group repartition with comparable skillsets.

## About

For the purpose of our RESTify controlled experiment we strive for control groups with comparable skill sets. We want to ensure that the insight compaared for a given group is as comparable as possible to the data collected for any other group. This means we must ensure the group participants showcase comparable skills for the technologies involved.  
This repository contains a simple python program to automatize the group partition task, based on the recruits self-declared skill sets.
